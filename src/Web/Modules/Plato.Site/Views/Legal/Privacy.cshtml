                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Information Gathered and Tracked by InstantASP</h5>
                        InstantASP may collect various types of information from visitors to our website or from phone or email conversations, which are described in more detail below. In some instances, we may combine one type of information with another type of information and store them together in our records. In all cases, however, we strive to limit the amount of information we collect and store to that which is necessary to provide you the relevant services.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Organizational Information We Collect</h5>
                        Within our Sites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a InstantASP Property. We may collect this information through different methods, including (without limitation):

                        <p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with InstantASP, although registration is not required except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information and references to help us better serve you.

                                    Order Forms and Enrollment Forms. Our order forms securely collect visitor’s contact information and payment information to use for order fulfillment and this information may be shared with our partners or resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions.
                                </li>
                                <li>

You may change/cancel information relating to your profile online at any time.
                                </li>

                                    Online forums and social networks. Any Personal Information that you choose to submit to one of our online forums or social networks may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these community areas. You should carefully consider whether you wish to submit Personal Information to these forums or social networks and should tailor any content you submit appropriately.
                                </li>

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Personal Information We Collect</h5>
                        The Personal Information collected by InstantASP may include, but is not necessarily limited to:
                        <p>

                                <li>
                                    Contact information (such as your name, title, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Financial/credit card and payment information (please see the “Third Party Payment Processor” section for more information);
                                </li>

                        </p>
                        Where applicable, if you choose to access, or log in to, any InstantASP Website using your Google, Facebook, Yahoo, or other accounts accepted by the applicable InstantASP Websites, the third-party site may share with us certain Personal Information.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Sensitive Information</h5>
                        We ask that you not send or otherwise share with us any sensitive Personal Information, which includes but is not limited to your government-issued ID numbers (e.g. Social Security Number or driver’s license number), racial or ethnic information, political or religious opinions, or your health information.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Do Not Track</h5>
                        Without a common industry or legal standard for interpreting Do Not Track (DNT) signals, InstantASP does not respond to browser DNT signals. We will continue to monitor further development of a DNT standard by the privacy community and industry.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">How InstantASP uses your information</h5>
                        InstantASP does not sell, lease or rent the Personal Information you share with us with third-parties.
                        <br /><br />
                        InstantASP may share, disclose, or provide your Personal Information to third parties: (i) when attempting to collect a payment or debt; (ii) when required to combat fraud or to protect our interests; (iii) to enforce our Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or any terms of service or end user license agreement of InstantASP; (iv) when required to do so by law or in response to legal process or lawful requests, including from law enforcement or government agencies; (v) within and among our affiliates and subsidiaries; or (vi) as part of a merger, sale of our business or assets, or dissolution.

Examples may include providing hosting and network services, information technology support, and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Personal Information we collect only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.
                        <br /><br />
                        We never use or share the Personal Information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
                        <Br /><br />
                        European citizens may submit requests relating to their own personal data collected by InstantASP (including without limitation, a request to access and/or delete their personal data) by submitting a GDPR Data Subject Access Request.

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Non personally identifiable information</h5>
                        As you browse our Sites, our web servers collect non-personal information about your visit for the operation and improvement of the InstantASP Properties, to track Site trends and statistics, and to prevent Product license abuse. Via server logs, we monitor statistics such as the number of visitors to our Sites, which pages on the Sites that people visit most often and from which domains visitors come to the Sites. While we gather this type of information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Sites, monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use them.

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">How we use Cookies</h5>
                        A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique information.

A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive.
                        We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) and other technologies to help us collect information such as domain names, IP address (which may consist of a static or dynamic IP-address, and will sometimes point to a specific identifiable computer or device), browser type, operating system, access times, referring/exit web site addresses, information regarding your experience with InstantASP Properties, and other data (“Other Information”) to enhance your experience using the Sites.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Informed Consent to Data Collection and Processing</h5>
                        InstantASP will rely on current and prospective customers to determine what information they would like to receive about our products, services and partners and will inform all visitors to our websites of their rights regarding information collection and tracking and provide the ability for an individual to amend their selections in the future.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Third Party Payment Processor</h5>
                        We use third-party service providers (“Payment Processors”) to manage credit card processing. Under our agreement with service providers, they are not permitted to store, retain, or use your Personal Information or your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. In certain cases, we may have access to the last four digits of your credit card number, its expiration date, and the billing address, which we will use solely to assist us in providing the product or service you purchased.
                        In addition, we and our service providers may use any information processed pursuant to this section at an aggregate level for internal business analyzes and fraud prevention.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information</h5>
                        InstantASP may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use our Sites or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward.
                        We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for InstantASP to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.<br /><br />
                        You may request to review, correct, delete or otherwise modify any of the personal information that you have previously provided to us through the InstantASP Properties.
                        If you have registered for an account with InstantASP, you may generally update your user settings, profile or organization’s settings by logging into the applicable Site or Service with your username and password and editing your settings or profile.
                        To update your billing information, discontinue your account, and/or request return or deletion of your Personal Information associated with your account, please contact your account representative or the customer service team for the applicable Service.

                        <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold text-uppercase">GDPR Data Subject Access Request</h5>
                        There is no fee to submit a GDPR Data Subject Access Request, but InstantASP reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee for requests that are unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.  After receiving your data subject access request, we may contact you to request additional supporting information and/or proof of your identity. This helps us to safeguard your privacy and personal data.
